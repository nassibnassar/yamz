Thus far, the SeaIce metadictionary consists of a database API, a 
command line tool called "sea", and an HTTP server frontend called "ice". 
Before you get started, you need to set up a database and some software 
packages. On Ubuntu, grab the follwoing:
  
  python-flask . . . . . . . Simple HTTP server.

  mysql-server . . . . . . . We're using MySQL as our database for the 
                             moment. 

  python-mysqldb . . . . . . Python API for MySQL.

  python-pip . . . . . . . . Package manager for additional Python 
                             programs. 

We need to download a package from pip that handles configuration files
nicely. Do: 

  $ sudo pip install configparser

Now set up a database in MySQL: 

  $ mysql --user=USER --password=PASS
  mysql> create database DBNAME (such as seaice) 
  mysql> commit
  mysql> exit

Lastly, create a configuration file for the database and user account
you set up. Create a file called ~/.seaice like: 

  [default]
  dbname = seaice
  user = USER
  password = PASS1
  [viewer]
  dbname = seaice
  user = viewer
  password = PASS2
  [contributor]
  dbname = seaice
  user = contributor
  password = PASS3

Set the correct file permissions with: 

  $ chmod 600 ~/.seaice

Then you should be good to go! To test everything is sane, do: 

  $ ./sea --init-db

To run the WebUI, do 
 
  $ ./ice
  
Open your browser and go to "localhost:5000". Have fun! -Chris
