      <p>
	  The YAMZ Metadictionary is an open vocabulary of metadata terms
	  from all domains and from all parts of "metadata speech".  That
	  will be exciting the
	  <a href="#more">more about metadata</a> you know.
      </p>

      <p>
	  In brief, with no login required, anyone can search for and link
	  to terms.  Login to create and edit your terms, and to comment on
	  others' terms.  
	  <a href="/guidelines">Community guidelines</a> help make
          the metadictionary a high-quality cross-domain metadata 
	  lexicon that is directly connected to evolving user needs.
      </p>

      <h4>From specialized projects</h4>
      <p>
	  Almost every software project needs controlled vocabularies for
	  interacting with users.  Design effort that goes into selecting
	  terms for a search interface, dropdown pick list, data entry
	  instructions, etc. has to researched and recorded.  YAMZ provides
	  a platform for you to take advantage of prior work and to share
	  your own new or divergent work with others, whether you are one
	  developer making UI design choices or a large working group
	  creating an ontology to drive an API.
      </p>

      <h4>To international standards</h4>
      <p>
	  Maintaining and developing international standards is normally
	  an expensive, inefficient, design-by-committee process producing
	  results that are out-of-date as soon as they are published.
	  With the metadictionary change will be rapid and affordable,
	  driven by practitioners and active testers.  There will be no
	  need for panels of busy experts to convene and deliberate.  We
	  expect dramatic simplification of vocabulary evolution compared
	  to traditional methods that have created an overwhelming number
	  of overlapping, conflicting vocabularies to choose from.  YAMZ
	  is not the first crowdsourced metadata dictionary, but as a
	  shelter for living, changing machine-readable terminology, it
	  is not unlike Yet Another Metadata Zoo.
      </p>

      <p>
          The hope is that users &ndash; people creating and receiving
	  machine-readable descriptions of objects they care about &ndash;
	  will be able to find
	  most of the terms they need in <i>one place</i> namely, the
	  metadictionary.  One vocabulary, one namespace.  This should
	  reduce the number of namespaces, namespace clutter, and the
	  expense of maintaining crosswalks with other vocabularies.
          And the vocabulary is completely ready for linked data application,
	  each term having its own permalink (an ARK identifier).
      </p>
      
      <h3>Basic metadictionary structure</h3>

      <p>
          Across YAMZ there are three disjoint term classes.
	  Classification is ongoing and fully-automated, based on voting
	  and user reputation. 
          
          <h4>Vernacular</h4>
            <li>all terms are born here and considered to be works-in-progress</li>
            <li>unstable terms; permalink points to a definition that may change</li>
            <li>anyone can propose new vernacular terms</li>
            <li>proposer(s) of a term "own" it initially; only they can make changes</li>
            <li>communities of interest spring up around related term clusters</li>
            <li>term tagging make it easy for communities (eg, working groups) to switch focus to selected term subsets</li>

          <h4>Canonical</h4>
            <li>terms safe for short- or long-term reference</li>
            <li>stable terms; permalink points to an unchanging definition</li>
            <li>terms move from vernacular to canonical by consensus</li>
            <li>terms still subject to voting</li>

          <h4>Deprecated</h4>
            <li>stable terms, but deprecated for long-term reference</li>
            <li>terms move from canonical to archival by consensus</li>
            <li>archival terms have links such as "ObsoletedBy: term X"</li>
      </p>

      <h3>Some background</h3>

<h4>Metadata and data</h4>
<p>
Metadata is structured information for describing things we care about.
It looks like text with extra punctuation to mark different regions,
and elements and values within those regions.  That structure makes the
information readable by software, which in turn helps us organize,
manage, analyze, and discover things we care about.
</p>
<p>
Real computational power comes when there is wide agreement on metadata
terms, such as element names and the values they take on.  The goal of
YAMZ is to support finding, creating, and achieving community accord on
high-quality terms.  These are the terms that you and others will use
to create high-quality metadata. Unlike a regular dictionary, the
metadictionary is therefore about terms used to create <i>structured</i>
(machine-readable) information.
</p>
<p>
The metadictionary supports data too.  Like metadata, data is structured
information, but with a shift in emphasis away from being <i>about</i> a
particular thing.  Some people say there's no important difference
between data and metadata.
</p>

<h4>Assertions about things</h4>
<p>
Metadata looks like a group of assertions about a particular thing, such
as a document.  For example, metadata may assert that a given document's
title is X, its author Y, and its publication date Z.
</p>
<p>
It's not always obvious what thing a metadata assertion is about.
Term definitions often refer to it with a word like "thing", "resource",
or "object".  Thus a "title" element might be defined as "a name given
to the resource".  Which exact "resource" won't be found in a term
definition but is revealed elsewhere in the metadata or by context.
For example, metadata embedded in a JPEG file is usually assumed to
describe an image embedded in the same file, and a metadata record often
has a special place to hold an identifier for the object being described.
</p>

<h4>Elements and values</h4>
<p>
Lots of terms define metadata/data elements, which are small categories
of information, such as "title", "author", or "response".  An element
might also be a structured statement that itself contains other elements.
A "location" element might contain "latitude" and "longitude" elements.
Other elements are meant to take on metadata/data values, for example,
pieces of text or personal names.
</p>
<p>
Terms help identify metadata/data values, especially when they are
limited in some way.  For example, a "response" element might be one of
"yes", "no", or "maybe".  A "count" element might take an infinite number
of values, but always restricted to "integer".
</p>

      <p>
	  YAMZ was initially developed in 2013-2014 by the Metadata Working
	  Group of the NSF-funded
	  <a href="http://www.dataone.org">DataONE</a> initiative.
	  It was later extended with support from the
	  <a href="https://www.diglib.org">Digital Library Federation</a>.
	  Working group members were John Kunze (chair), Jane Greenberg (chair),
	  Christopher Patton (lead developer), Karthik Ram, Greg Janée,
	  Nassib Nassar, Angela Murillo, Sarah Callaghan, Rob Guralnick,
	  and Tim Robertson.
