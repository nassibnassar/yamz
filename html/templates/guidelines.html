<h4>What YAMZ is for</h4>
<p>
YAMZ is an open vocabulary of metadata terms from all domains and
from all parts of metadata speech.  You are free to use it to search
for, use, share, and reference term definitions, as well as to create and
edit your own terms, and comment on others' terms.  Those freedoms are
granted provided you take responsibility for your edits, and in using
YAMZ you support a civil environment, do not violate copyright or other
laws, and do no harm to its technical infrastructure.
</p>
<h4>What it is not</h4>
<p>
YAMZ is not
<ul>
<li>... an encyclopedia. A definition is approximately one sentence,
    not an essay.
</li>
<li>... a grammar. Whether a term is required or optional is out of
    scope.  A term is like a nano-standard, and its definition may link
    out to external documents specifying rules for given communities.
</li>
<li>... a regular dictionary. While its terms resemble natural language
    terms, they are actually formal jargon often inspired by natural
    language.  YAMZ should only contain terms that directly support
    machine-readable descriptions and the metadictionary itself.
</li>
<li>... a bunch of sub-vocabularies. If your working group in the XYZ
    domain wants its own version of "thingummy", resist the temptation to
    create "XYZ_thingummy", or similarly making the domain part of the term.
    Instead consider creating "thingummy" and annotating its definition with
    the tag reference "#XYZ" so that your group can narrow its focus to #XYZ
    terms as needed.  It is a feature that YAMZ is ultimately one large,
    flat namespace with no domain borders.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Term parts</h3>
<p>
Terms consist of several parts:  a term string, definition, unique concept
identifier, example section, and comments section.  Term definitions
should be in English.  Newlines (line breaks) are preserved on display.
</p>

<a name="#termstring"></a>
<h4>Term string</h4>
<p>
A term string (or label) is one or more words that communicate the
concept being defined.

<ul>
<li>A term string should contain only letters, digits, hyphens, and
    underscores.  If it has more than one word, exactly one space
    separates each word.
</li>
<li>Although definitions are in English, the term string may be derived
    from any natural language.  Whatever its origin, consideration should
    be given to making it easy to spell, pronounce, and use in English
    sentences.
</li>
<li>Prefer creating a term in the singular form, and in such a way that
    the plural form need not also be defined.  This approach is often
    easier, clearer, and more flexible than creating a term in the plural
    form.
</li>
<li>A term string need not be unique in the metadictionary, but consider
    carefully if you want to create a new term with an existing string.
    Either way, each term gets a unique and persistent concept identifier
    when it is first created.  Two terms with the same term string may be
    meant to compete with or to complement each other.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="#termdef"></a>
<h4>Term definition</h4>
<p>
With the term string established, your term definition should consist
of two main parts (see <a
href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/622/01/">[1]</a> and
<a href="https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/def.html">[2]</a>):
<ul>
<li>the <i>class</i> to which the named thing belongs, followed by
</li>
<li><i>differentiating</i> characteristics that distinguish it from
others of its class.
</li>
</ul>
In particular, a definition will usually start with "A", "An", or "The".
As an example, for the term "water",
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A clear liquid made up of hydrogen and oxygen molecules.
</p>
the class is "clear liquid".  If the term string is an acronym, expand it
inside parentheses (using capital letters to delineate the acronym), and
insert the expansion at the very beginning of the definition.
As an example, for the term "ABC",
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Apple Bovine Cooler) An ointment for treating overheated cows.
</p>

<a name="#examples"></a>
<h4>Examples and comments</h4>
<p>
Text in the examples and comments can use all of the references described
below.  As in definitions, newlines (line breaks) are preserved on display.
</p>

<h4>Referencing</h4>
<p>
In term definitions, examples, and comments you can create actionable
links to words and concepts defined in YAMZ and elsewhere.
</p>

<h5>Term references</h5>
<p>
When you create or edit text, a construct like
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#{t: <i>multi-word term string</i>}<br>
or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&amp;<i>term</i>
</p>
<p>
refers to a term (the second is a shorthand for when the term string
consists of just one word).  After you save your editing, YAMZ converts
this to a standard internal form:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#{t: <i>term string</i> | <i>concept identifier</i>}
</p>
On display this reference will look like an ordinary link to the named
term, and when your mouse hovers over it that term's definition should
appear.  Term references can be used liberally inside definitions,
examples, and comments.
</p>

<h5>Tag references</h5>
<p>
Tag references are like term references, but are meant to appear only in
definitions of terms being tagged.  A group of one or more tags (no
commas between them) is to be separated from the end of the definition by
a single newline. A tag is not an integral or permanent part of a
definition, but only an annotation identifying a sub-community, such as a
working group trying to focus on a term subset for the duration of its
work. On display, a tag reference looks like a link embedded in a little
tile.  When you hover over it a definition appears, and when you click on
it YAMZ performs a search for all terms bearing that tag.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#<i>tag</i>
</p>
<p>
On editing, you can enter a tag by putting a '#' in front of it or using
the internal form to which it will be converted.  The internal form (in
the current software release) is slightly different from the displayed
form to make it more unique as a search string.  For example, the tag
"#foo" becomes
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#{g: xqfoo | h<i>NNNN</i>}<br>
</p>
<p>
where "h<i>NNNN</i>" is the persistent concept identifier assigned to it.
In a list of terms or in its own definition, a tag's term string appears
with a '#' in front of it.
</p>

<h5>External links</h5>
<p>
If needed, you can also add general links to external content using
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#{k: <i>link string</i> | <i>URL (web address)</i>}<br>
or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#{k: <i>URL (web address)</i>}
</p>
<p>
These links are not to be used in the definition proper, but you can
enter them in a separate note, such as,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note: context for this term's use may be found at #{k: example.com/xyzterms}.
</p>

<h4>Defining values or substructure</h4>
<p>
You can list the values or elements that a given term takes on by adding
them to the end of its definition (but before any tags).  When a term
takes elements (has substructure), first start the definition with
something like
"A <a href="http://www.yamz.net/term=h1237">structured statement</a>
defining ...", followed by distinguishing characteristics.  Then, at the
end of the definition (but before any tags), add a newline, "Elements: ",
and a list of elements.  For example, a definition for "collector" might
be entered like this:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A person who collects things of a certain type.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Elements: &age, &height, &weight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#geology #botany
</p>
<p>
A term may have either an element list, a value list, or neither, but not
both.  A value list should also be placed at the end, as in:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An indicator of whether the thing is difficult.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Values: &yes, &no, &maybe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#finance<br>
</p>
