# ConnectorPool.py - implementation of a thread-safe DB connector 
# pool for SeaIce. Also defined here is the class ScopedSeaIceConnector 
# which inherits class SeaIceConnector. This is a DB connector that is 
# acquired from SeaIceConnectorPool and is automatically released to the 
# pool when it goes out of scope.
