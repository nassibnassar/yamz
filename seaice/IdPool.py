class IdPool:
  """ 
    A thread-safe object for producing and consuming table row IDs within 
    a particluar context, i.e. ``SI.Terms``, ``SI.Users``, and ``SI.Comments``. 
    When initialized, an instance queries the table for all assigned IDs in 
    ascending order. Continuous regions of unassigned IDs are found and added 
    to the pool. The highest assigned ID is noticed so that when the pool is 
    empty, the producer function returns the next highest avaialble.

    **TODO** This could be made more space-efficient by combining contiguous 
    free IDs into ranges.
